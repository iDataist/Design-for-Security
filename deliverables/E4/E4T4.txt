# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Move the web service instance from the public subnet to the private subnet.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
It will not prevent unauthorized access if the attack instance is in the VPC.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. The encryption is only applied to new objects.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
The changes will be gone.
