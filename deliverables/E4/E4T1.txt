# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Disable passwords
- Secure Access With Systems Manager
- Use a configuration management tool to enforce hardening and configuration policies
- Do not allow login to instances (deploy immutable instances)

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the event that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- Use instance profile roles for Applications running on instances or containers
- Implement least Privilege Access to the S3 bucket
- Enable data encryption
