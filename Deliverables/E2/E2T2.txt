1. Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
    - Config:
        - securityhub-restricted-ssh-3d50734e
        - securityhub-restricted-rdp-be509775
        - securityhub-vpc-flow-logs-enabled-95435021
        - securityhub-s3-bucket-logging-enabled-f42a70b3

    - Security Hub:
        - Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
        - Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389

    - Inspector:
        - No password complexity mechanism or restrictions are configured on instance i-08f44d6278ea87d2a in your assessment target. This allows users to set simple passwords, thereby increasing the chances of unauthorized users gaining access and misusing accounts.
        - Instance i-08f44d6278ea87d2a is configured to support password authentication over SSH. Password authentication is susceptible to brute-force attacks and should be disabled in favor of key-based authentication where possible.
        - Minimum length for passwords is not configured on instance i-08f44d6278ea87d2a in your assessment target.
        - Instance i-08f44d6278ea87d2a is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack.
        - On instance i-08f44d6278ea87d2a, process 'python3' is listening on TCP port 5000 which is reachable from the internet
        - Aggregate network exposure: On instance i-08f44d6278ea87d2a, ports are reachable from the internet through ENI eni-038f345ffcc02e844 and security group sg-07e99d4f944dc4854
        - On instance i-08f44d6278ea87d2a, process 'sshd' is listening on TCP port 22 which is associated with 'SSH' and is reachable from the internet
        - On instance i-08f44d6278ea87d2a, process 'systemd-network' is listening on UDP port 68 which is associated with 'DHCP' and is reachable from the internet

2. Provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
    - Remove SSH Vulnerability on the Application Instance
    - Apply Network Controls to Restrict Application Server Traffic
    - Least Privilege Access to S3
    - Apply Default Server-side Encryption to the S3 Bucket
